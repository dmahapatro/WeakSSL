This plugin will deliberately break the Java SSL security model.
It is useful for working in development environments or test
environments where you have a generated SSL certificate. Notice
one of the modules detects the Grails test mode and reads the
Grails generated SSL cert and provides an SSL exception for it.

NOTE: This is a sketch. I have not tested this.
